# KulturPass - Open Source Precepts

With the application to implement the KulturPass solution, we also decided to develop essential parts of the software with the open source approach. 
On the one hand, we want to offer the users transparency on the development of the mobile app, and thus also create trust and confidence that the data and preferences of the users are secure at all times and a responsible handling is ensured.

On the other hand, we hope that the openness of code and documentation will lead to a stimulating exchange, a fruitful dialog and, like in other open source projects, an enagaged community. We are especially grateful for

- Feedback on the implementation or the features of the KulturPass app
- Questions about the technical solution
- Comments and feedback on the code and/or documentation of the project
- suggestions and ideas for enhancements or new features
- pro-active feedback on test results from self-used endpoints that we may not have tested
- any kind of input on the implemented processes and procedures

This project has adopted the Contributor Covenant our code of conduct. Please see the details in our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All contributors must abide by the code of conduct.

However, we will only be able to put the part of the software developed exclusively for the KulturPass under the open source umbrella. We are not authorized to publish commercial products, their implementation and the individual customizing here. This applies in particular to the backend solutions

- SAP Customer Data Cloud
- SAP Commerce Cloud
- Mirakl
- SAP S/4HANA
- but also connectors in accordance with the respective license terms and conditions
- as well as, if applicable, the interfaces of the providers for identity verification.

If you want to get deeper insight into the KulturPass app, a good source to start investigation might be the [Architecture Documentation](../technical-documentation/technical-architecture-01.md).
