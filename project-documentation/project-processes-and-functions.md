# KulturPass - Project Processes and Functions

The KulturPass project basically implements a cultural marketplace where the KulturPass app users consume the goods and services.
For the vendors the following processes and functions are relevant on the platform:

- Vendor Onboarding (including the steps: [vendor identification and registration](https://github.com/kulturpass-de/kulturpass-documentation/edit/feature/documentation-update/project-documentation/project-processes-and-functions.md#vendor-identification-and-registration), [initial shop settings](https://github.com/kulturpass-de/kulturpass-documentation/edit/feature/documentation-update/project-documentation/project-processes-and-functions.md#initial-shop-settings), initial product maintenance, initial offer creation)
- Order Management including cancellation and returns
- Financial Processes

The young people, the users of the KulturPass app, are the consumers of the goods and services offered on the KulturPass marketplace. This mobile app implements a number of capabilities and functions for the youth:

- Registration
- Geospatial services
- Offer browsing and filtering
- Ordering, cancellation and returns of goods and services

This documentation focuses on the project side of the processes and functions. A more technical deep dive you find in the [Technical Processes and Functions](../technical-documentation/technical-processes-and-functions.md).

## Vendor identification and registration

To provide an attractive markteplace for the KulturPass users, it is crucial to have a colorful mix, a wide variety of sellers of cultural offers. Subsequently, the KulturPass comes with an open concept to identify and register as a seller. This process is as simple as possible, both legally and technically. In principle, there are no exclusion criteria for participation in the Kurlturpass, as long as a vendor is eligible under the EU cultural funding program. During the identification and registration process the seller has to pass basically three steps:
1. Agreements (terms & conditions, data safety and security)
2. EU questionnaire
3. ELSTER registration process with the digital certificate of the seller organization. To find more details about the technical registration, check the section [Seller Registration with ELSTER](https://github.com/kulturpass-de/kulturpass-documentation/blob/main/technical-documentation/seller-registration-with-elster.md) 

The registration procedure also asks for initial name of the marketplace shop and creates the vendor's shop in the background. Once the registration process is completed successfully, the seller can access the shop and start with configuration of basic settings.

## Initial shop settings

From the shop owner's viewpoint, there are three important settings to be maintained:
- Physical address/location details of the shop; this is important for the distance calculation based on the geospacial services)
- Accessibility information for the shop location
- Bank account details; otherwise money transfer from BMK to the shop owner will fail.

If these tasks are perfomed successfully, the vendor can start entering the product and offer data into th e system.
