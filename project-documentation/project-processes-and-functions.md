# KulturPass - Project Processes and Functions

The KulturPass project basically implements a cultural marketplace where the KulturPass app users consume the goods and services.
For the vendors the following processes and functions are relevant on the platform:

- Vendor Onboarding (including the steps: identification, registration, initial shop settings, initial product maintenance, initial offer creation)
- Order Management including cancellation and returns
- Financial Processes

The young people, the users of the KulturPass app, are the consumers of the goods and services offered on the KulturPass marketplace. This mobile app implements a number of capabilities and functions for the youth:

- Registration
- Geospatial services
- Offer browsing and filtering
- Ordering, cancellation and returns of goods and services

This documentation focuses on the project side of the processes and functions. A more technical deep dive you find in the [Technical Processes and Functions](../technical-documentation/technical-processes-and-functions.md).
