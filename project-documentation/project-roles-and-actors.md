# KulturPass DE - Roles and Actors

## Main roles: Vendor and Consumer

Basically, the KulturPass solution shall connect the providers of cultural services, goods, and events (the **vendors**, like museums, stages, movie theaters, book shops etc.) with the young people as **consumers** of those offerings. From the commercial viewpoint, the vendors act in the role of a provider or seller, even if a given offer is for free and will not drain the consumer's credit.
The solution design defines the following responsibilities and capabilities for these roles:

### Vendor

- Identification and registration on the cultural marketplace
- Maintaining a list of products[^1] and offers within the shop
- Process orders by accepting or rejecting them
- Retrieve reports (transaction overview, shop activity etc.) from the platform

### Consumer

- Download the KulturPass DE mobile app from the Apple Appstore or from the Google Playstore
- Identify and register on the marketplace
- Retrieve the government-funded personal credit
- Browse, search, and filter the offers of the vendors leveraging the KuluturPass mobile app
- Reserve cultural goods, services, tickets for events etc. based on the available credit line[^2]
- Return unused reservations, goods, tickets etc. accroding to the terms and conditions of the vendor
[^1]: We may provide a prepared list of products for a given product category that can be utilized by the vendor. But this prepared list does not limit the list of products - the vendor is free to add individual products via manual input, CSV upload or API.
[^2]: Additionally, we may add the option to order even if the available credit line ist not sufficient. In that case, the remaining amount would need to be paid in cash on the vendor's premises by the consumer.

## Administrative roles

The KulturPass project is **promoted by the German government**, in particular by the _Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media (BKM)_. On behalf of the BKM, the **operational management** of the project as well as the tasks of supporting the community will be conducted by the [foundation _Digitale Chancen_](https://www.digitale-chancen.de/). For all questions, comments and suggestions, you are welcome to contact the community management via [support@kulturpass.de](mailto:support@kulturpass.de).
