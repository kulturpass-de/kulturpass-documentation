# KulturPass - Technical Processes and Functions

The KulturPass implements a cultural marketplace where KulturPass app users consume the goods and services. To get a better picture on how the solution components interact with each other, you may follow the documentation on the [Technical Architecture](technical-architecture-01.md).

For the vendors the following processes and functions are relevant on the platform:

- Vendor Onboarding (including the steps: identification, registration, initial shop settings, initial product maintenance, initial offer creation)
- Order Management including cancellation and returns (including refunding)
- Financial Processes

The young people, the users of the KulturPass app, are the consumers of the goods and services offered on the KulturPass marketplace. This mobile app implements a number of capabilities and functions for the youth:

- Identification and registration
- Management of account settings
- Geospatial servcices
- Offer browsing and filtering
- Ordering, cancellation and returns of goods and services

This documentation focuses on the technical implementation of the processes and functions. A more project-related view you find in the [Project Processes and Functions](../project-documentation/project-processes-and-functions.md).
